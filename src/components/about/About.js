              Hey! I&apos;m Numan, I&apos;m a MERN stack developer with a passion for building web applications and mobile apps. I have expertise in using ReactJS and React Native, two powerful frameworks for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

            <p className={styles.aboutText}>
              With ReactJS, I enjoy crafting responsive and scalable web applications. Leveraging the component-based architecture, I can create reusable UI components that enhance code maintainability and facilitate a smooth development process. ReactJS's virtual DOM and efficient rendering make it an ideal choice for building performant applications.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.aboutText}>
              In addition to web development, I am also skilled in React Native, allowing me to extend my expertise to mobile app development. React Native enables me to build cross-platform apps using a single codebase, saving time and effort. I appreciate the ability to leverage the power of ReactJS to create native-like mobile experiences for both iOS and Android platforms.
